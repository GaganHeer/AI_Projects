### Artificial Neural Network - Cartpole
- This Python project uses the OpenAI Gym library for creating the game environment. 
- The OpenAI Gym library only supports Linux and OSX environments at the moment. 
- I've included a trained model that can be used by changing the value of line #109 to 'bestModel.h5' instead of 'modelNameHere.h5' else it will create and train a new model. 
- If rendering the environment is an issue then you can comment out the 'env.render()' function found at line #85 of the file.
- If you'd like to perform random actions instead of neural network prediction based ones you can uncomment line #91
